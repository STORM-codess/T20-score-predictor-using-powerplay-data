🏏 IPL First Innings Score Prediction & Powerplay Analysis

In this project, I utilized IPL data from 2022, 2023, and 2024 to extract detailed powerplay statistics (first 6 overs) for the first innings of matches. By analyzing key features such as runs scored, wickets lost, boundary count, and dot balls, I implemented Elastic Linear Regression (LR) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict the final score of a match.

🔍 Year-on-Year Trends & Evolution of the Game
Throughout these three seasons, noticeable shifts in the game’s dynamics were observed:

📉 Decrease in Average Dot Balls: Teams have adopted more aggressive batting strategies, resulting in fewer dot balls over the years.
🚀 Increase in Powerplay Runs: With innovative batting techniques and favorable pitch conditions, the average number of runs scored during the powerplay has significantly increased from 2022 to 2024.
🔥 Rise in Boundary Counts: The frequency of boundaries has also surged, reflecting a more attacking mindset early in the innings.
📊 Predictive Modeling & Insights
I compared powerplay scores and critical features like wickets lost, dot balls, and boundary counts to understand their correlation with the final score. Each model (LR, RF, and DNN) offers unique perspectives on how these early-game factors influence match outcomes.

While cricket’s unpredictable nature leads to higher MAE and lower R² scores compared to typical regression tasks, this ensemble approach of combining multiple models provides valuable insights. These predictions can aid teams, players, and analysts in making better strategic decisions and optimizing gameplay based on evolving trends. 🚀
